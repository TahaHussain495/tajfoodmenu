<p>Butter Chicken Handi is a delightful variation of the classic butter chicken, cooked and served in a traditional handiâ€”a round, deep cooking vessel typically made of clay or metal. This dish is a rich and creamy North Indian delicacy that combines tender pieces of marinated chicken with a velvety tomato-based gravy enriched with butter and cream. The chicken is first marinated with yogurt, lemon juice, and aromatic spices such as ginger, garlic, turmeric, and garam masala, then cooked to perfection in the handi, which enhances the flavors and adds an earthy aroma to the dish.

    The gravy is made by simmering tomatoes with spices like cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom, then blended until smooth and combined with butter, cream, and a hint of honey for a perfect balance of tanginess and sweetness. The result is a luscious and flavorful dish that pairs beautifully with naan, paratha, or steamed rice. Butter Chicken Handi is a favorite at Indian restaurants and households alike, particularly for special occasions and festive meals, and is beloved for its luxurious texture and satisfying taste.</p>
