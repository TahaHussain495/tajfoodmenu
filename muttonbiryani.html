    <p>Mutton Biryani is famous across India, Pakistan, and the Middle East, with regional variations adding unique touches. The Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani, known for its “dum” cooking method, where the pot is sealed with dough and cooked on low heat, is particularly iconic. Kolkata, Lucknow, and Karachi also have distinctive styles of mutton biryani, each reflecting local culinary traditions. Beyond South Asia, it is cherished in places with a significant diaspora, such as the Gulf countries, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This dish is a must-have at festivals, weddings, and family gatherings, celebrated for its hearty and satisfying taste.
