    <p>Chicken Makhni Handi is a rich and indulgent North Indian dish, celebrated for its creamy texture and buttery flavor. The dish derives its name from makhni, meaning "buttery," and handi, the traditional pot in which it is cooked. It features tender pieces of chicken simmered in a velvety tomato-based gravy that is infused with butter, cream, and a blend of aromatic spices.

        The preparation begins with marinating the chicken in yogurt and spices like ginger, garlic, and garam masala, ensuring the meat is flavorful and juicy. The gravy is crafted by cooking pureed tomatoes with a combination of spices such as cumin, coriander, and fenugreek, which lend a distinctive aroma and taste. A generous amount of butter and fresh cream is added to the gravy, creating its signature richness. Cooking the dish in a handi enhances its flavor, adding a rustic and earthy note.
        
        Chicken Makhni Handi is a popular choice in Indian and Pakistani cuisine, often served with naan, roti, or basmati rice. Its luxurious taste and creamy consistency make it a favorite for special occasions, festive meals, and restaurant menus, appealing to those who love mild yet flavorful curries.
